# System_Integrity_Verifier
This is a System Integrity Verifier, a program that monitores a directory and its files in order to allow the user to see if any 
changes have been done.It is intended to work on POSIX systems. 
The data stored in the verification file serves as basis for the integrity verification of your files.
It regards the length of the file, a hashed version of its contents, the owner and owner group and the last modification time.
The output of the verification is contained in the report file. 

This project was developed as an assignment for the Network and System Security course at Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola, Karlskrona, Sweden.
