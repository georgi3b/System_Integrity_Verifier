This is a System Integrity Verifier, a program that monitores a directory 
and its files in order to allow the user to see if any changes have been done. 
The data contained in the verification file serves as basis for the integrity
verification. The output of the verification is contained in the report file.

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-i|-v|-h
You are now in -h (help) mode.
 
-i : initialisation mode. Use this if you are monitoring a new directory.
   Takes as arguments: -D <monitored_directory>, -V <verification_file>, 
   -R <report_file>, -H <hash_function>.

   Example: siv -i -D important_directory -V verificationDB -R my_report.txt -H sha1

-v : verification mode. To be used if you have already run the 			  
   initialisation mode. It checks the entries of the monitored directory 		   
   against the information already stored in the verification file. It outputs 	
   everything that diverges into the report file. Takes as arguments: -D 	  
   <monitored_directory>, -V <verification_file>, -R <report_file.txt>.

   Example: siv -v -D important_directory -V verificationDB -R my_report2.txt
   
 ATTENTION: The paths given as input must not contain spaces. Please escape the 
 spaces or use single quotes!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-D <monitored_directory> : Takes the absolute or relative path to a directory to be 
			 monitored

-V <verification_file> : Takes the path to the verification file.
			The verification file must be outside the monitored 
			directory. It contains an entry for every file in the
			directory along with information about its size, owner, 
			group owner, file permissions, last modification date and a 		
			hashed string of its contents. 

-R <report_file> :Takes the path to the report file. The report file must be ouside 		  
		  the monitored directory. It saves the paths to the monitored    		
	  	  directory and to the verification file. It contains summary
		  information about initialisation/verification mode .
   		  This must be a .txt file. 

-H <hash_function> : The function to be used to hash the file contents. A different 
		   hash value means that the file contents have been changed. The 
		   supported hash functions are MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-358, 		  	
		   SHA-512.  To be used only in initialisation mode.
		   Usage: -H md5 | sha1 | sha256 | sha358 | sha512
